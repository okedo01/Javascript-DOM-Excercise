    <h1>Cursor enters and leaves element</h1>
    <p>
      In this scenario we want the color of the circle to change depending on
      the type of cursor movement. Use the function toggleColor to turn the
      circle orange when the cursor moves onto it. Reuse the same function to
      turn it black when the cursor leaves it. The tricky part is that you have
      to call toggleColor with different values for the parameter isEntering.
      Verify that your code is working by hovering the circle with the mouse
      cursor and leaving it again.
